## [ 2 ] Relative Units (Flexible & Responsive)

| Unit     | Description                                                             | Notes                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **%**    | Percentage : Defines sizes relative to the parent elementâ€™s dimensions. | Good for fluid layouts.           |
| **em**   | Relative to the elementâ€™s own font size.                                | `1.5em` = 1.5 Ã— parent font size. |
| **rem**  | Relative to the `<html>` font size.                                     | `1rem = root font size`.          |
| **vw**   | Viewport Width : `1vw = 1%` of the viewport width.                      | Used for full-width elements.     |
| **vh**   | Viewport Height : `1vh = 1%` of the viewport height.                    | Used for full-screen layouts.     |
| **vmin** | Takes the **smaller** value between `vw` and `vh`.                      | Helps with responsive elements.   |
| **vmax** | Takes the **larger** value between `vw` and `vh`.                       | Ensures elements scale properly.  |
| **ch**   | Relative to the width of the `"0"` character in the font.               | Useful for text layout.           |
| **ex**   | Based on the height of lowercase `"x"` in the font.                     | Less commonly used.               |

âœ… **Best for:** Responsive typography, flexible layouts, mobile-friendly designs.

### **Example:**

```css
.flexible-box {
    width: 50%;   /* Takes half of the parent elementâ€™s width */
    height: 30vh; /* Occupies 30% of the viewport height */
}
```
