# Here are the key changes:
 
- **Global Adjustments:**  
  - Applied `box-sizing: border-box;` to all elements for consistent sizing.  
  - Ensured `html` and `body` take up `100%` height to provide a stable layout.

  - Standardized `line-height: 1.5` for better readability.  
  - Applied `-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%` to prevent unwanted font size adjustments in iOS.

  - Set `small` to `80%` of the base font size.  
  - Ensured `code, kbd, samp` use a monospaced font.  

- **Lists & Structural Elements:**  
  - Removed default margins and paddings from `ul` and `ol` for consistency.  
  - Made `main` a `block` element for proper rendering in older browsers.  
  - Adjusted `hr` to have `box-sizing: content-box` and controlled overflow.  

- **Text-Level Semantics:**

  - Ensured `abbr[title]` has a consistent underline style.  
  - Set `b` and `strong` to `font-weight: bolder`.  
  - Adjusted `sub` and `sup` positions and sizes for proper alignment.  

- **Images & Media:**  
  - Ensured `img` elements do not have borders and scale properly with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`.  

- **Form Elements:**  
  - Unified `button, input, select, textarea` styles by inheriting font properties.  
  - Prevented `button, input` from cropping overflowed text.  
  - Removed default `border-style` from `button` focus elements for consistency.  
  - Set custom `outline` styling for focused `button` elements.  
  - Improved `legend` display and padding for better alignment.  
  - Ensured `progress` aligns properly with text.  
  - Adjusted `textarea` for better scrolling behavior.  
  - Standardized `checkbox` and `radio` button sizing.  
  - Removed default appearance of `search` input decorations.  

- **Interactive Elements & Tables:**

  - Standardized `table` styles with `border-collapse: collapse` and removed spacing.  
  - Set `template` elements to `display: none`.

These changes improve cross-browser consistency, enhance accessibility, and create a solid foundation for styling.
